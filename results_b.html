    <p>You guys aren’t just friends, you’re ~BEST FRIENDS~. Having a BFF is great,
      but if you want to be more than that, it’s gonna get real tricky. You may
      be way, way too deep in the friendzone or you may have an advantage since
      you know this person so well.
    </p>

    <p>So basically.. You’ll never know if you don’t try!
    </p>

    <p>Either way, try not to lose your best friend. A best friend is someone
      who comes to your house, eats all of your food, and then uses your stuff
      with their dusty Cheeto fingers. They’re there for you no matter what..
      They’ll let you cry on their shoulder when your cat died even though they
      don’t even know your cat that well.
