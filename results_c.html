    <h2>You are: Crushing</h2>

    <h4>“Someone’s got a crush!”</h4>

    <img width="350px" height="350px" src="https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_9633047f-6934-477e-8c8a-5ac2f8392f22?wid=488&hei=488&fmt=pjpeg" alt="">

    <h3>It looks like you’re crushing pretty hard. When you have a crush on someone
      it means you’ve developed an infatuation and strong desire to be with them.
      Chances are you really like this person but are too shy or nervous to talk to them.
      You may find yourself regularly stalking this person’s social media.
    </h3>

    <h3>In the future, try not to develop too many crushes. The clue is in the
      name because they crush your soul and everything you stand for : )
    </h3>

    <h3>Eventually crushes may grow into love or your feelings might wear away.
      So don't jump into conclusions and mistake a crush for love. A crush might
      give you butterflies in your stomach, but a real relationship is not always
      attainable. The best way to avoid this: if you feel attracted to someone,
      talk to them right away and whenever you can!!!! This will create a real
      connection between the two of you instead of the weird illusion of a
      connection that is brought on by crushing.
    </h3>
