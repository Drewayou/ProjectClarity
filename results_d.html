    <h3>Wow, you’re dating! This means you’re in the early stages of a relationship.
      A time where you’ll find yourselves going out on dates to get to know the
      other person better. This is merely a prelude to being a fully fledged couple.
    </h3>

    <h3>Remember: Communication is key! Make sure you’re both looking for the same
      thing. Dating is often viewed as being in “commitment” while having no real
      commitment with/to another person. Complicated, huh?
    </h3>

    <h3>Think of dating as a ship. A type of ship where two people must board in
      order for it to work. These ships can be a very good experience or very bad.
      These ships more often then not sink, crash, or disappear. If you’re lucky,
      your ship will stay afloat for a long period of time.
