    <h3>Hate to break it to you, but you two are “just friends”. The friendzone
      can be a particularly aggravating and un-escapable metaphorical place.
      It’s a place where you have a crush on someone but they only want to be
      friends. Many friend-zoned people suffer from a condition known as
      “extreme butthurt”. This can turn them into cold and bitter people simply
      because they don’t seem to understand that a man/woman has the right to
      reject someone if they see them as just a friend.
    </h3>

    <h3>However, if you are in the friendzone, don’t fear! Friends are cool.
    </h3>

    <h3>A friend is someone who is aware of how dumb you are and still manage to be
      seen with you in public. They can make you laugh till you pee your pants.
      Friends are God’s way of apologizing for the family you’re born with. So
      don’t worry about it too much.
    </h3>
