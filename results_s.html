    <h3>It’s official! You’re in a serious, committed relationship. Because of
      mutual compatibility and attraction, you two agreed to move up from the
      dating/courting status into a relationship.
    </h3>

    <h3>We’re happy for you. Proud even. Just tone down the PDA.
    </h3>

    <h3>To summarize, being in a serious relationship means you are legally
      allowed to touch another person’s butt. You might as well start your
      engagement ring shopping. Congrats!!!
    </h3>
