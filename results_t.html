    <h2>You are: Talking</h2>

    <h4>“What are we?”</h4>

    <img width="400px" height="350px" src="https://preview.redd.it/1tm5yjqf90731.jpg?width=940&auto=webp&s=773d3db1375f43fb7c415c0bb3591dd7a65750a8" alt="">

    <h3>So you’re in the talking stage. You two have established that you like
      each other but you aren't technically “boyfriend" and "girlfriend” yet.
      You may or may not be not exclusive but you guys definitely have some kind
      of relationship. It’s above friends, and below officially dating.
    </h3>

    <h3>This relationship phase often causes a ton of confusion and requires a lot
      of explaining.
    </h3>

    <h3>Since “Talking” is so confusing, it’s best to define the relationship ASAP.
      Until then, have fun texting your boo who’s not your boo into the ungodly
      hours of the night.
    </h3>
